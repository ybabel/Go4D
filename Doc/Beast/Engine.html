<h1>ALOM3D : 3D rendering engine</h1>

<p>What can be done with it :</p>

<ul>
    <li>6 degree of freedom</li>
    <li>Gouraud : a normal (average of the normal of the faces
        that use a plot) must be processed for each plot</li>
    <li>Bump : a dynamic light map must be processed</li>
    <li>Draw faces, points, lines. A single face can be drawed by
        various maner, depending on the speed required (linear
        mapping for fast rendering, hypperbolic+mipmap+alphablending+ZBuffer+phong
        lightmap+transluency+fog for accurate rendering)</li>
    <li>[take advantage of hardware] : not planed for the moment</li>
    <li>easily inculde of Physic rule, collision detection, AI</li>
    <li>Hierarchical objects definition</li>
    <li>Hierarchical bounding box or sphere of fast collision
        detection</li>
    <li>Polygon accuray collision detection</li>
    <li>Render the cube demo</li>
    <li>Render the IIE demo</li>
    <li>Render the physic demo</li>
    <li>Be integrated in the interactive 3D editor/modeler</li>
    <li>Used to render outdoor/indoor scenes</li>
    <li>Render the beast demo (without much time consuming in
        rendering)</li>
    <li>Read vrml, asc or other objects definition files</li>
    <li>Include voxel engine !!! to draw the environment</li>
    <li>Possibility to include CSG later</li>
    <li>Possibility to include constraints later (for constrained
        editor)</li>
    <li>BSP ?!?</li>
    <li>Dynamic moving lights, ambient lights, spot lights,
        colored lights (like the java3D sphere lighted with green
        and red)</li>
    <li>Support 8bit palette colors / true color (16bit, 32bit),
        possibly dynamicly (use templates maybe in images)</li>
    <li>Add NURBS (or quake III like patch) to the rendering
        engine</li>
    <li>Engine customization (fog/not fog, lights/not lights,
        ...) possibly done with templates ?+fields</li>
</ul>

<p>Rendering paradigm :</p>

<ul>
    <li>The Space system</li>
    <li>The View system</li>
    <li>The Camera (make link from space to view, transform space
        into view)</li>
    <li>The projector (that project the space objets into a view
        object : X,Y,Z+RGB -&gt; X,Y+Color) = camera</li>
    <li>The rasterizer (previously known as the
        TemplateFaceDrawer)</li>
</ul>

<p>The rendering pipeline :</p>

<ol dir="ltr">
    <li>The objects high level definitions, the only objects
        manipulated by the game/demo : include objects (cube+sphere+face
        defined objects+composite objects) + lights + physics +
        constraints + dynamic. The objects must be said Static/dynamic
        in order that the engine knows if it can optimze their
        use or not. Objects can be defined by hand, by a program
        (beasts), or in a file</li>
    <li>Objects position computing into camera base</li>
    <li>High level visibility determination (use bounding sphere
        and frustrum clipping), high level clipping</li>
    <li>Tesselation (convert cube in face, sphere in faces, ...)</li>
    <li>Environement processing : lights computation (for each
        visible point, depend on the average normal of the point)</li>
    <li>Low level clipping (frustrum face clipping)</li>
    <li>Faces, plots, lines sorting</li>
    <li>Projecting (points and colors)</li>
    <li>Rasterinzation (effective drawing) in the image (use a
        clut for lights)</li>
</ol>

<p>Questions :</p>

<ul>
    <li>Where can I include fog in this engine ? the fog can be
        computed for the entire face, the same procress than
        shading is used (the rasterizer is given a CLUT index
        which can represent the fog+shade color)</li>
</ul>
